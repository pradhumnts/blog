							<p>Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime.
			
							That feeling when we're driving away from people and they recede on the plain till we see their specks dispersing? - it's the too-huge world vaulting us, and it's good-bye. But we learn forward to the next crazy venture beneath the skies.<br>To move, to breath , to fly, to float, to gain all while you give, to roam the roads of lands remote, To travel is to live.</p>
